A) 🗺️ Project: Google Places–Powered Bar Hopping Routes
What your app does:

User enters a starting location (address)
App finds nearby bars using Google Places
App computes an “optimal” walking route
Outputs an ordered list + distance estimate (optionally a map link)
This is clearly more than just fetching data — it’s transforming + reasoning over it.
🔑 APIs You’ll Use (Google)
1. Google Places API (Nearby Search)
Used to find bars near a location.
Endpoint:


https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json
Key parameters:

location=lat,lng
radius=1500 (meters)
type=bar
key=YOUR_API_KEY
Returns:

Place name
Latitude / longitude
Rating
Place ID
2. Google Geocoding API
Convert address → lat/lng
Endpoint:


https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json
(Optional) 3. Google Directions API
If you want walking distance/time instead of straight-line distance.
⚠️ This costs more quota-wise, so I recommend:

Use Haversine distance for routing
Only use Directions for final display or skip it entirely
🔐 VERY IMPORTANT: API Key Safety
This matters a lot for grading.

✅ Correct way:
Store key in environment variable:

export GOOGLE_API_KEY="yourkeyhere"
In Python:


import os
API_KEY = os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")
❌ Never:
Hardcode the key
Commit .env files
Paste key into README
If you leak a key → automatic zero (as stated in the assignment).
🧠 What “Optimal” Means (TA-Friendly Definition)
You should explicitly define this in your README:

“Optimal” is defined as minimizing total walking distance using a greedy nearest-neighbor strategy.
This is 100% acceptable and shows algorithmic thinking.
🧩 Implementation Plan (Python)
Step 1: Get User Input

address = input("Enter a starting address: ")
max_bars = int(input("How many bars? "))
Step 2: Geocode Address
Call Google Geocoding API

Extract:

lat = response["results"][0]["geometry"]["location"]["lat"]
lng = response["results"][0]["geometry"]["location"]["lng"]
Step 3: Fetch Nearby Bars
Call Places Nearby Search:


bars = [
  {
    "name": place["name"],
    "lat": place["geometry"]["location"]["lat"],
    "lng": place["geometry"]["location"]["lng"],
    "rating": place.get("rating", None)
  }
]
You can:

Sort by rating
Limit to top 10–15 bars
Step 4: Distance Calculation (No API Calls)
Use Haversine formula:


def haversine(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):
    ...
This avoids rate limits and looks smart.
Step 5: Build the Route
Greedy nearest-neighbor:


route = []
current = start_locationwhile bars and len(route) < max_bars:
    next_bar = min(
        bars,
        key=lambda b: haversine(current["lat"], current["lng"], b["lat"], b["lng"])
    )
    route.append(next_bar)
    bars.remove(next_bar)
    current = next_bar
Step 6: Output Results

Optimal Bar-Hopping Route (Walking):

1. Kelly’s Bar – 0.18 miles (⭐ 4.6)
2. Hemingway’s – 0.22 miles (⭐ 4.4)
3. Jack’s Bar – 0.14 miles (⭐ 4.7)

Total distance: 0.54 miles
Optionally generate:

Google Maps URL with waypoints
CSV or text summary

📝 README (What You’ll Explain)
Your README should clearly explain:

Which Google APIs are used
How HTTP requests are made with requests
What data is extracted from the JSON responses
How distance is computed
How the routing logic works
How to set the API key locally
This is exactly what the rubric wants.
🤖 Prompt Log (What to Include)
Examples:

“Explain how Google Places Nearby Search works”
“Help me design a greedy routing algorithm”
“Explain the structure of the Places API JSON response”
Short, intentional, thoughtful.
⚠️ One Honest Warning
Google APIs are powerful, but:

They do require billing to be enabled
You must restrict your API key in Google Cloud Console
Restrict to specific APIs
Restrict HTTP referrers (or IP if local)
If you want zero risk, OpenStreetMap is safer — but Google Places is still fine if you’re careful.
🚀 Next Steps (Pick One)
I can:

Write starter Python code for this exact project
Help you set up the Google Cloud API key safely
Draft a polished README
Help you define portfolio wording
Just tell me what you want next 👇

I want to implement this plan can you write me a python script that does this.

B) Okay my code works very well in the console but I want to make it usable by a regular person. I am thinking maybe a web app that can run in browsers or something what are some ways I can implement my goal of making it usable to people

C) okay I want to use fastAPI to host my python script on a webpage can you plan out how I can do this. Right now all I have is the python script
